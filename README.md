> **Note about Versioning**: The Ultra Vehicle Card uses a smart versioning system that embeds the version number in filenames (e.g., `ultra-vehicle-card-2.0-Beta1.js`). This helps prevent caching issues when updating. The main file (`ultra-vehicle-card.js`) automatically redirects to the current version, so you'll always get the latest version after an update.

### Cool Tip

Hey there, fellow Home Assistant enthusiast! üè†‚ú®

Did you know that the Ultra Vehicle Card was inspired by a midnight coding session fueled by an unhealthy amount of caffeine and a sudden realization that cars deserve cool cards too? It's true!

If this card has made your dashboard a little more awesome or saved you from the treacherous "low fuel surprise," consider buying the developer a virtual Dr Pepper. It helps keep the creativity flowing and the code bug-free!

### Icon Configuration

<img width="300" alt="Icon Config" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62362632-ea5c-4ae4-a54b-0bc901a6c9c6">

For each icon in the grid, you can customize its appearance and behavior:

#### Icon Selection

- **Inactive Icon**: The icon displayed when the entity is in its "off" or inactive state.
- **Active Icon**: The icon shown when the entity is "on" or active.

To change an icon:

1. Click on the current icon.
2. Search for a new icon or select from the popular icons shown.
3. Click "no-icon" if you don't want an icon for that state.

#### Icon Colors

- **Inactive Color**: The color of the icon in its inactive state.
- **Active Color**: The color when the icon is active.

Use the color picker to select custom colors or input specific hex values.

#### Icon Style

Choose how the icon is displayed:

- **Icon**: Just the icon itself.
- **Round**: Icon within a circular background.
- **Square**: Icon within a square background.
- **Label**: Text label instead of an icon.

#### Icon Size

Adjust the size of the icon in pixels. This setting affects both the icon and its background (if using round or square style).

#### Text Size

Control the size of any text labels associated with the icon.

#### Text Position

If you want to display a label with your icon, choose where it appears:

- **None**: No label is shown.
- **Left/Right/Top/Bottom**: Places the label in the specified position relative to the icon.

#### Interaction

Determine what happens when a user clicks the icon:

- **More Info**: Opens the entity's more info dialog.
- **Toggle**: Switches the entity between on and off states.
- **Navigate**: Goes to a specific page in your Home Assistant interface.
- **Open URL**: Opens a specified web address.
- **Assist**: Opens the voice assistant.
- **Trigger**: Activates the entity (useful for automations or scripts).
- **None**: Disables interaction for this icon.

#### Vertical Alignment

Control how your icon and text align vertically:

- **Top**: Aligns content to the top
- **Center**: Centers content vertically (default)
- **Bottom**: Aligns content to the bottom

### State Configuration

This advanced feature allows you to customize when an icon is considered "active" or "inactive". For both active and inactive states, you have these options:

#### Default

When selected, the card uses built-in logic to determine the active state:

- For most entities, "on", "home", "open", "locked", etc. are considered active.
- For numeric sensors, any value above 0 is typically considered active.

#### Template

Allows you to write a custom Jinja2 template to determine the icon state. This is for advanced users who need complex logic. For example:

> {{ states('sensor.temperature') | float > 20 }}
> This would make the icon active when the temperature is above 20 degrees.

#### Attribute

You can base the icon state on a specific attribute of the entity. For example, if your car has a "status" attribute, you could set it to be active when status is "driving".

#### Option

For entities that have predefined options (like input_select), you can choose which option represents the active state.

### Practical Example

Let's say you're adding an icon for your car's climate control:

1. Search for and add the climate control entity.
2. Set the inactive icon to "mdi:air-conditioner" and active to "mdi:air-conditioner-on".
3. Choose blue for inactive and red for active colors.
4. Set the style to "Round" for a nice background effect.
5. Set the interaction to "Toggle" so you can turn it on/off directly from the card.
6. Add a label at the bottom showing "Climate".
7. In state configuration, you might use an attribute like "hvac_action" to determine when it's truly active, rather than just being on but not actively cooling/heating.
