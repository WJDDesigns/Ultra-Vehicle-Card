### Cool Tip

Hey there, fellow Home Assistant enthusiast! 🏠✨ 

Did you know that the Ultra Vehicle Card was inspired by a midnight coding session fueled by an unhealthy amount of caffeine and a sudden realization that cars deserve cool cards too? It's true!

If this card has made your dashboard a little more awesome or saved you from the treacherous "low fuel surprise," consider buying the developer a virtual Dr Pepper. It helps keep the creativity flowing and the code bug-free!
