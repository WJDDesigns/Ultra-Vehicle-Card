## üß© Template Mode Power

One of the most powerful features is template mode, which lets you use Home Assistant templates to determine icon states or values. This enables complex logic like:

```
{{ is_state('binary_sensor.car_charging', 'on') and states('sensor.battery_level')|int < 80 }}
```

This would make an icon active only when the car is charging AND battery is below 80%.

## üì± Example Configurations

## üñåÔ∏è Advanced Customization

### Custom Animations

Bars can animate based on entity states:

```yaml
bars:
  - entity: sensor.tesla_battery_level
    animation_entity: binary_sensor.car_charging
    animation_state: 'on'
    animation_type: 'pulse'
```

### Gradient Display Modes

Control how gradients display on bars:

```yaml
bars:
  - entity: sensor.tesla_battery_level
    use_gradient: true
    gradient_display_mode: 'value_based' # or "full"
    gradient_stops:
      - color: '#ff0000'
        position: 0
      - color: '#ffff00'
        position: 50
      - color: '#00ff00'
        position: 100
```

### Global CSS Injection

Add custom CSS directly to your card:

```yaml
global_css: |
  .my-custom-class {
    border-radius: 10px;
    box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);
  }
